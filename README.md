# 100-Days-Verilog-HDL-Challenge
Iâ€™m Janhavi, a final year engineering student on a mission to master Verilog HDL. This repository documents my 100-day journey of writing, debugging, and simulating Verilog code to build strong RTL fundamentals.

**Goals**

- Write clean, synthesizable Verilog
- Build simulation testbenches from scratch
- Learn to model hardware behaviorally and structurally
- Strengthen understanding of digital design concepts
